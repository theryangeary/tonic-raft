# tonic-raft

A library built on top of tonic and tokio, implementing the [Raft consensus
protocol](https://raft.github.io/). This library is intended to be used by
services striving to be highly available.

It is currently a work in progress, and service authors eager to make use of it
may find the material in the examples directory particularly helpful.
